# Changelog

### 2.0.5
I am currently in the process of re-modelling each of this mod's items, because some of them were rushed and I'd like for the mod to have a more complete visual style. These changes will come out gradually along with some fixes once I have time to investigate the more annoying bugs.
* **Revamped VFX** for Empathy
* **Revamped VFX** for Scavenger's Pack: Now named Scavenger's Pouch
* **Revamped VFX** for Elder Mutagen
* Updated to latest R2API version, but item displays won't work for a bit.
* Overkill Overdrive's Bustling Fungus and Focus Crystal buffs are now automatically disabled while UltimateCustomRun or VanillaRebalance are present, to avoid conflicts.
* Fixed One Ticket spamming the logs (I think)

### 2.0.4
* <details><summary>Apathy default regen boost 15 hp/s -> 20 hp/s</summary>Apathy's regen only occurs for 5 seconds at a time, so its effects shouldn't feel underwhelming. Might change more if necessary.</details>
* Overkill Overdrive now affects Void Fields cells
* Empathy and Apathy now properly utilize Overkill Overdrive's configurable radius boost
* Empathy now actually uses the config value for healing instead of 2
* Small VFX improvements to Overkill Overdrive, Empathy, Apathy, Drop Of Necrosis and Spattered Collection
* ATG Prototype optimizations
* Fixed some readme details

### 2.0.3
* <details><summary>Scattered Reflection default reflect damage boost per stack 70% -> 700%</summary>Scattered Reflection can be a potent item when it comes to damage prevention if you get the right build going, but its damage was always very underwhelming for a green item. This 10x increase seems huge but it really just bumps it up to usable levels, considering how low 7% really is.</details>
* <details><summary>Empathy default healing per hit 2 -> 4</summary>For its limitations, it really should have a bit more healing power than two leeching seeds.</details>
* <details><summary>Scavenger's Pack default uses 3 -> 2</summary>Scavenger's Pack is hard to balance because some consumable items are incredibly good, while others aren't. Having less uses might make one value their pack more, and consider which consumables they want to pick up.</details>
* <details><summary>Do Not Eat default pearl chance 8% -> 10%</summary>A little boost for this item, because it kind of needs it.</details>
* <details><summary>One Ticket now provides immunity to the Cripple debuff while it's being held.</summary>Fighting Perfected Elites is a challenge on its own with their shields and extra stats, but on top of that, the cripple debuff made it way more tedious than challenging. It also gives you a much needed "advantage" if you're forced to keep the item for difficult fights.</details>
* Overkill Overdrive now has an optional blacklist for Engineer turrets.
* One Ticket now has a proper consumed version.
* Fixed a conflict with ArtifactOfPotential and Do Not Eat.

### 2.0.2
* Overkill Overdrive no longer prevents bustling fungus from stacking. **However, be careful about using mods that change the radius of Bustling Fungus or Focus Crystal, as they'll most likely break this item and cause errors. I may add special support for mods like this in the future.**
* To compensate, the zones that Overkill Overdrive affects can now be enabled or disabled individually.
* 400 Tickets description clarified.

### 2.0.1
* Readme inconsistencies

### 1.1.1
* Fixed an issue where some enemies were untargetable by Huntress

### 1.1.0 - Due to the many changes, deleting or modifying your config file will be necessary.
